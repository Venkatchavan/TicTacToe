# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Xs and Os, is a two-player game where one player is "X" and the other is "O." The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Play against a friend on the same computer.
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly graphical interface for gameplay.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player wins and announces the result.
- **Draw Detection:** If no player wins, the game declares a draw.
- **Restart:** Restart the game at any time to play again.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Player 1 (X) starts the game.
3. Click on an empty cell to place your symbol.
4. Players take turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
5. If a player wins, the game announces the winner.
6. Click the "Restart" button to play another round.
